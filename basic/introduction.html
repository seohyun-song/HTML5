<!--
    HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
    - Hyper text markup language.
    - descrives the structure of web page.
    - consists of a series of elements.
    - elements tell the browser how to display the content
    - elements label pieces of content such as 'this is a heading', 'this is paragraph', 'this is link', etc.

    What is an HTML Element?
    <tagname> Content </tagname>
    The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag.

    **Some HTML elements have no content(like <br>). These elements are called empty elements.
    Empty elements do not have an end tag!

    Web Browsers?
    The purpose of a web browser is to read HTML documents and display them correctly.
    A browser does not display the HTML tags, but users them to determine how to display the document.
